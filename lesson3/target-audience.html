            Manager <br><br>He has been doing summer sales
            for a few years now in various states. The difference this year is that it is his first time in Idaho and
            his first time being a manager. Knowing the weather is important for him because it helps make sure that his
            team is dressed and ready for whatever the day may bring. <br>Benjamin he uses elementalforecast.com to stay 
            updated on the weather. That way heand his team have no excuse for having low sales on any given day.
            Bejamin is also in charge of weekend activities for his team. So he visits the mobile website to help him plan
            ahead. After all, the last time he did not check the weekend weather, they ended up going to the hot springs 
            on a rainy day.</p>

        <p class="explanation"><strong>Name: </strong> Sofia Anabella<br>
            <strong>Job Title: </strong>Tour Guide<br><br>
            Anabella has been hired this year to be a tour guide of a small park found in Eastern Idaho. Her and her family just moved from Virgina to Idaho
            so she is not too familiar with Idaho weather. Her boss has told her that this area
            has pretty consistant weather, but being from Virginia has taught her to always be prepared for the
            unexpected.<br>Anabella opens elementalforecast.com on her computer every morning to make sure that she is dressed properly.
            She gives tours on a daily basis, so she wants to make sure that she plans accordingly. She also has a 6 year 
            old that she gets ready for school. So she likes to make sure that he is dressed appropriately, otherwise he could get sick. 
            Anabelle also has a great fear of storms. She has heard that this year might bring more electrical storms than ever before, so 
            she also likes to use the websites storm watch on a weekly basis.
